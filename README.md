# My React App

This is a simple React application created to help you learn React from scratch. Below are the instructions to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- TypeScript (optional, but recommended for type safety)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-react-app.git
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `public/`: Contains static files like `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
  - `App.tsx`: The main application component.
  - `components/`: Directory for reusable components.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the application.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
